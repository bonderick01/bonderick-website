This repository holds the code for my personal website I created as a final project during spring 2024 semester in BAIS:3300 - Digital Product Management.

## What Did I Learn?

- I downloaded an HTML template file to speed up the process of formatting and getting the website presentable.
- I edited the template to include my details, add features that were relevant to me, and to remove existing template features I did'nt want to include.
- The files were validated to HTML5 standards, CSS3 standards and WCAG2.1 standards, level AA standards for accessibility.
- The website was deployed to Microsoft Azure cloud services as a static web application.
- The website was configured with a custom domain purchased and configured at [NameCheap](https://namecheap.com).
- The website was aligned with github, allowing me to learn about version control and pair programming.
